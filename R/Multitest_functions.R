#Alicia Petrany, draft as of 4/25/2023
#This file contains functions for DEGage complete, w
#hich is a full workflow from raw counts to annotated
#groups with differentially expressed genes



#'@title print.labels
#'@description
#'prints all labels identified after preprocessing
#'
#'@param labels cell type annotations for every cell
#'@returns nothing
print.labels <- function(labels){
  message("The following cell type annotations were generated:")
  for(i in levels(labels)){
    message(i)
  }
}

#'@title run.multitest
#'@description
#'calls DEGage for every comparison necessary in the DEGage_complete workflow
#'
#'@param allcounts the entire matrix of counts for all cells
#'@param group A factor which assigns conditions to cells as in Deseq2.
#'@param perm.preprocess A logical indicating whether or not to perform the permutation prefiltering step. Setting it to TRUE increases runtimes.
#'@param gene.filter.threshold A value between 0-1 which represents the maximum proportion of zeros a gene can have before being filtered out.
#'@param nperms An integer greater than 0 that indicates how many permutations will be carried out during the permutation test
#'@param nsubsample The number of cells to subsample for each condition
#'@param perm.pval P value for the permutation test to filter out genes with
#'@param ncores the number of cores to allocated for parallel computing
#'@param writing.dir A directory to write the results of each comparison to. It is HIGHLY reccomended to provide a directory.
#'@return Nothing if a directory is provided. If no directory is provided,
